	This program will run only under OS/2 !! It's the same famous file that
has been used for many first programs. I used it here to show how easy it is
to write routines in ASM with OS/2. Hello.exe shows the basic start and exit
routines as well as how to call the OS/2 API calls.
	For more information on OS/2 programming call :
